<h2><i><b>The Stock Market</i></b></h2>

<strong>What is the stock market?</strong>
<br>
<p class="Explanation">The stock market is where you buy and sell electronic shares in your company and other companies. From the stock market you can also see and track the current share value of all of the companies.</p>
<br>
<strong>What are shares?</strong>
<br>
<p class="Explanation">Shares represent your ownership of a company, this can be either your company or another company.  Shares directly represent the actual wealth of a company, so the more a share is worth then the more that company is worth.
When the day finishes, all shares in a company are converted into money (taken from the company bank account), so it is advantageous to work the stock market as a money making scheme.
Your company starts the day owning all 100 shares of your own company. This means that each share is worth 1 percent of your company.
At the beginning of the day, your company MUST register with the stock market and float 50% of your company shares on the stock market. This means your shares on the stock market can then be bought or sold by other companies.</p>
<br>
<strong>What does my share price mean?</strong>
<br>
<p class="Explanation">The share price is the current market value of your company’s shares. It is a rough guide to how well your company is doing and what it is worth.
Remember that at the end of the day all the shares you own (whether in your company or other companies) are converted into raw cash and added to your bank balance.
How to buy and sell from the stock market...
Shares are bought or sold at the stock market. You can buy any shares that are available on the stock market or sell any shares that your company currently owns. It is a good idea to devise a way to track how many shares you own because, remember, the more you own the more cash you stand to have at the end of the day.
Shares are bought or sold at the market price that is currently being displayed on the stock market screens (see picture below for an example share price list). Prices change from minute to minute, so you need to be quick to buy or sell the shares at the price that is currently shown.
The stock market charges a fee to buy and sell shares, this is normally 10% of the total transaction. When buying you are paying 10% more than the displayed price and when selling you are receiving 10% less. Make sure you take this into account when trading or you will lose money.
The stock market will only buy 5 shares and sell 5 shares in one trade.  If you wish to buy or sell more you will have to re-queue.</p>
