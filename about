<p2> The BT Business Enterprise Day event is aimed at around two-hundred Year 9 or Year
10 students of mixed ability. You are grouped together into 'businesses'
who compete to be the most successful company of the day.

At the end of the day, the most successful company will win.
Winning the day is quite simple; you must have the most cash in the bank at
the end of the day!

<br>There are a variety of methods to gain cash:

<br>-Completing tasks such as trading on a stock exchange

<br>-Using and managing a 'real' bank account

<br>-Corporate presentations

<br>-Negotiating

<br>-Raising capital thorugh physical and mental activities
<br>-Making cars from constituent parts such as engines and body panels (although these cost money to purchase themselves)


Ultimately, you are organising and building a factory that produces many cars at a great price.
