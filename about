<h2><i><b>About</b></i></h2>
<p>The BT Business Enterprise Day event is
aimed at around two-hundred Year 9 or Year 10 students of mixed
ability. You are grouped together into 'businesses' who compete to be
the most successful company of the day. At the end of the day, the
most successful company will win. Winning the day is quite simple;
you must have the most cash in the bank at the end of the day!</p>
