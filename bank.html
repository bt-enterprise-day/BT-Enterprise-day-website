<h1 style="text-align:center;">The bank</h1>
<p>The bank is an <b>important</b> part of the day. It could determine whether you win or not. You need to adhere to the following rules.
<h3><b>Bank Rules</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>To open your account your company needs to choose a loan amount (be cautious with the amount). You do this at the loan office.</li>
<li>Workers work to make money so you <b>must</b> pay them! The figure starts at &pound225 and is payable hourly.</li>
<li>Wages can increase and decrease depending on your success or failure. You may be able to <b>negotiate</b>.</li>
<li>The wage increases could depend on inflation and employee satisfaction. Be careful.</li>
<li>Interest is charged or added at the end of every hour. If you clear debts late, you may be fried.</li>
<li>The bank will close for lunch</li>
<li>The Bank Manager will only deal with high ranking company officers for important deals.</li>
<li>Transactions will only take place with official company badge wearers.</li>
<li>Bank managers are almost always fair and cant be corrupted.</li>
<li>Bank reserves the right to alter, defer, create, forget, enforce, and enhance as it sees fit.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The bank should be used wisely. It will earn you some interest, but largely its there for you to pay.</b></p>
