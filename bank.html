<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
<ul class="Explanation">
	<li>To open your account your company needs to choose a loan amount (be cautious with the amount). You do this at the loan office.</li>
	<li>Workers work to make money so you <b>must</b> pay them! The figure starts at &pound225 and is payable hourly.</li>
	<li>Wages can increase and decrease depending on your success or failure. You may be able to <b>negotiate</b>.</li>
	<li>The wage increases could depend on inflation and employee satisfaction. Be careful.</li>
	<li>Interest is charged or added at the end of every hour. If you clear debts late, you may be fried.</li>
	<li>The bank will close for lunch</li>
	<li>The Bank Manager will only deal with high ranking company officers for important deals.</li>
	<li>Transactions will only take place with official company badge wearers.</li>
	<li>Bank managers are almost always fair and cant be corrupted.</li>
	<li>Bank reserves the right to alter, defer, create, forget, enforce, and enhance as it sees fit.</li>
