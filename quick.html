<h2><i><b>Quick Start Guide</i></b></h2>
<p class="Paragraph"> By now you should have been placed into a company by your school. In your companies, each member should be allocated a role. You need the following roles in your company:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chief Executive Officer (CEO)</li>
	<li>Finance Director</li>
	<li>Technology Director</li>
	<li>Marketing Director</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>What is your Company's Goal?</strong>
<p class="Explanation">Your company's goal is to be the best of the day. To do this, you <b>must</b> have achieved the following by the time we close:
Have the most money in the bank (adjusted for share ownership)
Made at least one car (more cars = more money)
Complete the bureaucratic IDOT paperwork
Complete the end of day financial audit (all companies get audited)</p>
<br>
<strong>What does our Company do?</strong>
<br>
<p class="Explanation"> At the start of the day the CEO has to face facts - without a plan, your company will be losing money as soon as the day starts!
You will need to apply for a start-up loan desk beside the bank (to be able to invest in other activies early on in the day) and will pay interest on that money on the hour, every hour. The sooner you pay this loan off the better, as you will then earn interest on the balance in your bank account.
You will also be paying everybody in your team his or her wages, which, like interest, will be automatically taken out of your bank account, every hour.
So, you need to get some money in the bank as soon as possible. To do this, interact with the various desks such as the bank, stock-market and shop. 
If they haven't already, we recommend that you get all your team to hear about or read this document as soon as possible.</p>
